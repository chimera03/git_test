        <h2>Easiest way to make a Margerita pizza at home.</h2>
        <p>This classic pizza is made with everyday ingredients and topped with a simple fresh pizza sauce made from canned tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. You’ll want to make it over and over again!</p>
        <p>Also, It's recommended that you use a sourdough pizza dough.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients list</h3>
        <ul><strong>Pizza Dough:</strong>
            <li>2½ cups (300 g) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar
            </li>
            <li>½ teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>7 ounces (105°F to 115°F) warm water
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
            </li>
    
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>Pizza sauce:</strong>
            <li>1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)
            </li>
            <li>2-3 fresh garlic cloves(grated)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 large pinches of salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>Toppings:</strong>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>5-6 large fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>7 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese </li>
        
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Prepare Pizza Dough:</em>  whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together, thenCover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. </li>
            <li><em>Prepare the ingredients:</em>stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.</li>
            <li><em>Assemble the Pizza:</em>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown.</li>
            <li><em>The last touch:</em>Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.</li>
